# Deep-Learning-Assignment

This repository is based on a Deep Learning assignment being implemented on designing your own neural network from scratch.

# Part 1:

The datasets used are provided in the Datasets folder. 
For this part we will be using - `D1_non_linearly_seperable.csv`, `D2_linearly_seperable.csv` and `D3_3d_features.csv`.

## A. Designing your own logistic regression model.

## B. Splitting your dataset and plotting 3D graphs.

## C. Implementing a shallow neural network based on the given datasets.


# Part 2:
